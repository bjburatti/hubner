# Progressive Cross Validation for Model Selection

In this section we are going to talk about incremental cross validation. In the first part we are going to discuss the reason why we want to implement such technique in our system. Than we show the code that performs model selection in such code.

* Cross Validation
* Why Incremental Cross Validation?
* Example of incremental Cross Validation


## PCV 

In this boxes we are going to show an example of incremental cross validation. Let's beging importing the necessary libraries


```python
# import libraries
```


```python
If we recall the code that we used for , we had an outer loop that 
```
